# DecisionTree
Custom implementation of a decision tree.

CART (classificaiton and regression tree) models form two of the most popular machine learning algorithms: random forests and XGBoost. Thus, I want to gain a deeper understanding of how these models work. To do so, I've decided to implement the models from scratch.

The current Decision Tree model only handles continuous variables. I plan to update this in the future.
